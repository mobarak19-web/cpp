# Problem 001:  Print Numbers Between Two Integers
## Problem Statement

Write a C program that accepts two integers `a` and `b` from the user. The program should print all the even number between `a` and `b`. (USing While Loop)

### Input:
- Two integers `a` and `b`.

### Output:
- Print all numbers between `a` and `b` exclusively. If `a` is greater than `b`, print numbers in descending order. Otherwise, print them in ascending order.

### Example:

**Input:**
Enter the value of a: 5 
Enter the value of b: 10

**Output:**
All positive numbers are: 6 8 10


**Input:**
Enter the value of a: 2
Enter the value of b: 10

**Output:**
All positive numbers are: 2 4 6 8 10


# Problem 002:  Print Numbers Between Two Integers
## Problem Statement
Write a C program that accepts two integers `a` and `b` from the user. The program should print all the odd number between `a` and `b`. (Using for loop)

### Input:
- Two integers `a` and `b`.

### Output:
- Print all odd number between `a` and `b` exclusively. If `a` is greater than `b`, print numbers in descending order. Otherwise, print them in ascending order.

### Example:

**Input:**
Enter the value of a: 5 
Enter the value of b: 10

**Output:**
All odd numbers are: 5,7,9


**Input:**
Enter the value of a: 1 
Enter the value of b: 5

**Output:**
All odd numbers are: 1,3,5



# Problem 003:  Print Numbers Between Two Integers
## Problem Statement
Write a C program that accepts two integers `a` and `b` from the user. The program should print all the divisor of a between `a` and `b`.

### Input:
- Two integers `a` and `b`.

### Output:
- Print all divisor of  between `a` and `b` exclusively. If `a` is greater than `b`, print numbers in descending order. Otherwise, print them in ascending order.

### Example:

**Input:**
Enter the value of a: 2
Enter the value of b: 10

**Output:**
All divisor of 2 is: 2,4,6,8,10


**Input:**
Enter the value of a: 3
Enter the value of b: 10

**Output:**
All divisor of 3 is: 3,6,9
